      <!-- this is information about rock-climbing -->
      <p id="first-p">
        <b>ROCK CLIMBING</b> is an activity in which participants climb up, down or across natural rock formations or artificial rock walls.
        The goal is to reach the summit of a formation or the endpoint of a usually pre-defined route without falling.
        Rock climbing is a physically and mentally demanding sport, one that often tests a climber's strength, endurance, agility and
        balance along with mental control. It can be a dangerous activity and knowledge of proper climbing techniques and use of specialized
        climbing equipment is crucial for the safe completion of routes.

      <!-- this is the information about fishing  -->
      <p id="second-p"> <!-- using a paragraph tag to display the information -->
        <b>FISHING</b> is the activity of trying to catch fish. Fish are normally caught in the wild. Techniques for catching fish include hand gathering,
        spearing, netting, angling and trapping. Fishing may include catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as molluscs, cephalopods, crustaceans,
        and echinoderms. The term is not normally applied to catching farmed fish, or to aquatic mammals, such as whales where the term whaling is more appropriate.

      <!--this is information about hiking  -->
      <p id="third-p"> <!-- using a paragraph tag to display the information -->
        <b>HIKING</b> is an outdoor activity which consists of walking in natural environments, often on hiking trails. It is such a popular actvity that thre are numerous
        hiking organizations worldwide. The health benefits of different types of hiking have beem confirmed in studies.

      <!--this is information about camping  -->
      <p id="fourth-p"> <!-- using a paragraph tag to display the information -->
        <b>CAMPING</b> is an outdoor activity involving overnight stays away from home in a shelter, such as a tent. Generally participants leave developed areas to spend time
        outdoors in more natural ones in pursuit of activities providing them enjoyment. To be regarded as "camping" a minimum of one night is spent outdoors, distinguishing
        it from day-tripping, picnicking, and other similarly short-term recreational activities. Camping can be enjoyed through all four seasons.
        Camping as a recreational activity became popular among elites in the early 20th century. With time, it grew more democratic, and varied. Modern campers frequent publicly
        owned natural resources such as national and state parks, wilderness areas, and commercial campgrounds. Camping is a key part of many youth organizations around the world,
        such as Scouting, which use it to teach both self-reliance and teamwork.
